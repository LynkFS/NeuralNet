# NeuralNet
Object Pascal feed forward neural network component

Simple 3 layer feed-forward neural network component\
\
No dependencies\
Can be used in conjunction with DWS compilers\
\
demo: https://www.lynkit.com.au/neuralnet/neuralnet.html <br>
(compiled in QTX-IDE)
\
this demonstrates handwritten character recognition, based on the MNIST dataset\
The net is trained with only 1000 examples to limit training time\
(less than 30 sec on desktop, approx 4 min on mobile)\
which means it is not perfect.
